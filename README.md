# gather
Mobile app that gathers friends to eat or go grocery shopping together and connects classmates to form study sessions

## MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
   For our first MVP, the project must have the following features:
   
   - A functional, aesthetic login page.
   - A homepage for all events and gatherings, as well as a filtering system between users and friends.
   - The ability to create an event.
   - The ability to join a gathering, comment on it, withdraw from it, or delete the gathering.
   - An implementation of a way to request or recommend friends.
   
   Once finishing the MVP, teammates should be able to develop upon the MVP and add more features as time progresses. Below, I have listed the stretch goals, also known as other possible features we can add in our project as we finish the MVP. These are mostly possible features, and teammates are able to add their own strecth goals, or even add or restructure the MVP, as long as it's agreed upon by the team and approved by the team manager.
   
## Possible Features

## Recommended Software
These are software that I recommended teammates to use for the project. Teammates are free to use any software that comes to mind to build the application, but that should be decided as a team within the first weeks of project planning. Please let your teammates and project manager (me) know if you have experience working with a potential framework/software.
   
### Main Framework: React Native 
   
### Database: Firebase
   Generally easy to learn.
